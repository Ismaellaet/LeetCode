# Implement strStr()

Given two strings _needle_ and _haystack_, return the index of the first occurrence of _needle_ in _haystack_, or _-1_ if _needle_ is not part of _haystack_.

**Clarification:**

What should return when needle is an empty string? This is a great question to ask during an interview.

For the purpose of this problem, we will return 0 when _needle_ is an empty string. This is consistent to C's strstr() and Java's indexOf().

### Example 1:

    Input: haystack = "hello", needle = "ll"
    Output: 2

### Example 2:

    Input: haystack = "aaaaa", needle = "bba"
    Output: -1
