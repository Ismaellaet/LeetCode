# Binary Search
Given an array of integers nums which is sorted in ascending order, and an integer target, write a function to search target in nums. If target exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return -1.

## What is Binary Search?

Binary Search is a **searching algorithm** used in a sorted array by repeatdly dividing the search interval in half.

## Why two results?
The first result [(result.js)](./result.js) is more precise to the question.
The second [(resultA.js)](./resultA.js) was made because I wanted to make it more complete.
